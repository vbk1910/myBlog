        <div class="line">
        <p> My hobby is riding trains. Riding trains is a lot of fun. You get to look outside and it is so beautiful looking at the city and nature. Some trains have a food carraige which you can get food. It's nice relaxing in a train and playing. Trains are amazing because you don't need to keep your eyes open in a train. I've rode many transits: TTC, GO, UP Express, VIA Rail. </p>
